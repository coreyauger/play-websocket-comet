play-websocket-comet
====================

Scala - Play / Akka
This example project demonstrates the use of reactive web-sockets with comet fallback.  The push/pull framework forms the basis of a protocal layer used to communicate with Akka actors.  These actors could be looked up in a cluster, allowing the application to scale in a sane manor.

Other features include a slim front end design using angularjs, and bootstrap ui.  The script is written in coffee script to show of the integrated asset compiler.
